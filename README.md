## Name of Project: Jackie Summerfield Ceramics (website)

I have been asked to design a website to showcase ceramic artwork for Sculptor
Jackie Summerfield. This is an exciting project which will expand my skills as a web
developer. Jackie needs an online central hub that displays her work that also links
to her social media. This is a marketing decision that will turn her followers into
potential clients. The goal is to develop a professional looking, clean designed, easy
to navigate portfolio site that will provide potential clients with an overview of her
talents and a way to contact her for commissions.
